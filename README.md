The project was coded and tested using Java and coded in IntelliJ IDEA version 2019.3.3 (Community Edition)

The main method of the application is located in src.main.java.TargetProject.java. Running this will prompt the user to enter 4 
coordinates at a time. The user can continue to enter 4 coordinates until they no longer wish to add barren points. Once the user is finished adding coordinates, enter nothing (by carriage return) into the console ouput. The output will result in the smallest and largest fertile land points.

Tests are located in src.test.java and are Junit tests.
